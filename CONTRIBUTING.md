## Contributing Code

### Typical Workflow

1. Create a branch off of `develop`
2. Create a PR back into `develop`
3. A reviewer will evaluate the code changes and (more often than not, if deemed necessary) test the changes locally
4. Once approved and merged, test your changes on staging
5. If everything's dandy the card can be moved on to PO sign-off
6. Team leads will determine when the right time to cut a release, i.e., tag and deploy, typically this should be within a day or two

### Production Bugfix Workflow

1.  There may be times when it's necessary to create a branch off of `master` (e.g. a hotfix for the production environment)
1.  Coordinate with the team to deliver those changes to the production environment
1.  Team leads will determine when the right time to cut a release, i.e., tag and deploy, this would likely be right away under these exceptional circumstances
