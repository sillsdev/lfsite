   * This config is intended for starting the application server and waiting for it to be ready.

   * So:
   * - In CI we only use this feature to wait until the application is ready.
   * - In dev environments this is a handy fallback for starting the application automatically.
   *
   * `command` has to live until `url` is returning responses.
   * 'docker attach e2e-app' is an os-independent way to make that happen.
   *
   * The environment variable DEBUG=pw:webserver can be used to get full output from `command`.
